tags: long, smoker

ingredients:
- 900gm Royal Blue potatoes
- Salt
- 1tsp paprika
- 250gm red capsicum
- 80gm white onion (or substitute for yellow capsicum)
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 40gm salted capers
- 50gm cornichons
- 2Tbsp roughly chopped fresh dill fronds
- 150g mayonnaise
- 1 lemon
- 600g salmon fillet
- 3tsp olive oil
- 1tsp salt flakes
- Wood chips for smoking

directions:
- Remove salmon from fridge about 40 minutes before cooking to remove the chill. 
- Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees celcius. Heat large roasting tin for potatoes.
- Cut un-eeled potatoes for salad into even sized 2cm chunks. Boil potatoes at a simmer for 6 minutes, or until the tip of a paring knife is easily inserted into 3 or 4mm of potato. Drain potatoes, place back into saucepan. Season potatoes with 1 teaspoon salt and paprika, place lid on pan and shake to fluff edges.
- Pour olive oil into hot roasting pan and swirl to cover base. Carefully tip potatoes into pan in a single layer. Roast for about 40 minutes, tossing once until crisp and golden. 
- Prepare remainder of components to server with salmon and place in separate piles in large bowl.
- Dice red capsicum into 1cm pieces.
- Peel onion and cut into thin lyonnaise slices.
- Rinse capers well to remove salt and pat dry.
- Cut cornichons into 1/2cm thick slices.
- Roughly chop dill fronds. Cover bowl (and refrigerate salad components if preparing in advance)
- Make dressing. Mix mayonnaise with 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 to 3 teaspoons water, until thin enough to drizzle.
- Prepare water smoker as per smoker instructions. Give fire at least 20 minutes to light and settle.
- Prepare salmon. Toss fillets with oil and salt.
- Place onto rack in water smoker and cover with lid. **TIP:** Try cooking the fish on the warming rack of the bbq directly above the smoker. 
- Smoke fish for 20 to 45 minutes depending on heat of smoker and thickness of fish, until springy to touch. 
- Remove and rest salmon on covered plate.
- When salmon is cool enough to handle, remove skin and break flesh into 3cm chunks. 
- Tip warm potatoes into salad bowl, add salmon and gently toss with other components so as to keep salmon chunks intact. 
- Place half amount of salad onto platter and drizzle with half dressing. Top with remaining salad and drizzle with remaining dressing. Serve.

tags: long, slow-cooker

ingredients:
- 40g butter
- 2 tablespoons (40ml) vegetable oil
- 4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 tablespoon Indian curry paste
- 2 teaspoons tandoori masala
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 140g tomato paste
- 15 green cardamom pods
- 1 (400ml) tin coconut milk
- 1 cup plain yoghurt
- pinch salt to taste
- basmati rice, to serve


directions:
- TIP - Take a needle and thread and pierce the needle through the top of the cardamom pod. Continue with all the cardamom pods and then tie the ends together in a knot so it looks like a ring (you don't have to do this if you don't want the extra step...it just makes it easy to remove and nobody crunches down on a big bitter cardamom pod).
- Melt the butter and vegetable oil in a large frypan over medium heat. Stir in the chicken, onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in the curry powder, curry paste, tandoori masala, garam masala and tomato paste until no lumps of tomato paste remain. Pour into a slow cooker, and stir in the cardamom pods, coconut milk and yoghurt. Season to taste with salt.
- Cook on High 4 to 6 hours, or on Low 6 to 8 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has reduced to your desired consistency. Remove and discard the cardamom pods. Serve with basmati rice.

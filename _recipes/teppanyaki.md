tags: quick

ingredients:
- 1 Tbsp sake
- 2 Tbsp mirin
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 4 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp grated ginger
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds
- Various vegetables for grilling, all cut into thin slices; capsicum, different types of mushrooms, carrot, pumpkin, bean sprouts, cabbage etc. 
- Some meat for grilling, cut into pieces; beef steak, chicken, salmon, pork etc.
- Rice, for serving

directions:
- Cook rice as per packet instructions.
- In a small saucepan, combine sake and mirin. Turn the heat to medium and let the alcohol evaporate for 1-2 minutes.
- Add the sugar and whisk to combine.
- Add the soy sauce.
- After a short while, add the garlic and grated ginger. 
- Add sesame oil.
- Add the sesame seeds and whisk together.
- Turn off the heat and allow the sauce to cool at room temperature.
- Gather all the ingredients for grilling.
- Heat both the cooking grill on a medium-low heat and the serving hotplate on a low heat, both lightly greased with olive oil (spray is easier).
- Carefully add the meat to the grill, and very lightly season with salt and pepper. The meat should be laid out neatly and flat on the grill to achieve noticeable grill lines, and to ensure all pieces are cooked evently. Cook until just under-cooked, then remove from the pan. 
- Carefully add the vegetables to the pan (except cabbage and bean sprouts) in a the same neat manner as the meat, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning to get an even grill.
- Transfer both the meat and the vegetables to the warm serving hotplate. Turn the heat on the hotplate up slightly.
- Quickly grill any cabbage and bean sprouts, then transfer to the serving hotplate.
- Add a small amount of water to the hotplate to create a sizzle, then immediately serve with rice. The teppenyaki sauce can either be used to dip pieces in to, or drizzled over the rice bowl.

Recipe by Namiko Chen From [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/teppanyaki/).

If possible, prepare the teppanyaki sauce a day in advance to allow the flavours to intensify. The sauce can be stored in the refridgerator for up to 3-4 weeks or the freezer for a couple of months.

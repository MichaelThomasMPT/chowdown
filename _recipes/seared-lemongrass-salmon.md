title:  "Seared Lemongrass Salmon"
image: seared-lemongrass-salmon.png
tags: quick

ingredients:
- Olive Oil
- Coconut Milk - 165ml
- Water - 3/4 cup
- Salt - 1/4 tsp
- Jasmine Rice - for 2 people
- Lemongrass - 1 stalk
- Kaffir Lime Leaves - 2 leaves
- Garlic - 3 cloves
- Soy Sauce - 1 tbs
- Salmon - 2 pieces
- Carrot - 1
- Zucchini - 1
- Asian Greens - 1 bunch

directions:
- In a medium saucepan, combine the coconut milk, water and salt and bring to the boil over a high heat. Add the jasmine rice, stir, cover with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 12 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and keep covered until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, 10 minutes.
- While the rice is cooking, trim the top and bottom of the lemongrass and remove the tough outer layer. You should be left with a 4cm piece of white stalk. Finely chop the lemongrass stalk and the kaffir lime leaves. Finely chop the garlic (or use a garlic press). In a medium bowl, combine the lemongrass, kaffir lime, 1/2 the garlic, olive oil (1 tbs for 2 people), and the soy sauce. Mix well, then add the salmon fillets and toss to coat. 
- Thinly slice the carrot (unpeeled) into half moons. Cut the zucchini into 1cm batons. Roughly chop the Asian greens.
- In a medium frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the carrot and zucchini and cook, tossing, until softened, 3-4 minutes. Add the Asian greens and cook until wilted, 2 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a medium bowl. Cover to keep warm.
- Return the frying pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the salmon, skin-side down, to the pan and cook until just cooked through, 2-4 minutes on each side (depending on thickness). Add any remaining marinade to the pan and once bubbling, remove from the heat. The marinade will caramelise in the pan, this adds to the flavour! 
- Divide the coconut rice, lemongrass salmon and garlic veggies between plates. Spoon over any sauce from the pan.

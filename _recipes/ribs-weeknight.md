ingredients:
- 1 rack of baby-back ribs
- 1/4 cup BBQ sauce (alternatively, see component for a home-made maple bourbon glaze)
- Salt & pepper
- 1 tsp or more of liquid smoke
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar (optional)

directions:
- Prepare & Season Baby Back Ribs; Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs with a paper towel. Season the ribs with a generous amount of kosher salt and ground black pepper.
- Preheat oven to 180-200 degrees.
- Pressure Cook Baby Back Ribs; Add 2 â€“ 3 drops of liquid smoke in Instant Pot (optional). Add in 1 cup (250ml) of cold water (or apple cider vinegar) and a trivet. Place the baby back ribs on top of the trivet. With Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 16 minutes (tender with a bit of chew) to 25 minutes (fall-off-the-bone tender), then Full Natural Release.
- If making the Maple Bourbon Glaze, do so now.
- Brush the ribs generously with BBQ sauce or glaze, and then place in oven for a few minutes until the BBQ sauce is caramelized.
- Remove ribs from oven, chop up, and serve.

tags: long, slow cooker

ingredients:
- 1 1/2 - 2kg beef roast, chuck, topside or blade.
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoon szechuan pepper corns
- 1 x star anise
- 10-12 mini hot dog rolls

directions:
- Set a large slow cooker onto high (4 hours) or low (6-8 hours). Place in the beef roast. For more colour sear the beef on both sides before placing into the slow cooker.
- In a small bowl place the chicken stock, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, honey, mustard, szechuan pepper corns and star anise.
- Mix together and pour over the beef. Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook for the allotted time depending on the temperature.
- Baste the roast half way through the cooking time with the sauce at the base of the roast.
- Once the roast has been cooked for the allotted time remove from the slow cooker and set in a large roasting tin. Shred the meat lightly with a fork.
- Pour the remaining gravy collected at the bottom of the slow cooker through a wire sieve. Throw away anything caught up in the sieve.
- Pour 1/2 cup of the gravy over the shredded meat and cover with foil to keep warm.
- Measure out the remaining gravy into a saucepan. In a small cup add 1 tablespoon of cornflour for every cup of gravy. Mix together with a small amount of water. Slowly add to the warm gravy. Bring the gravy up to a simmer and stir constantly until the gravy has thickened.
- Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
- Cut the hot dog rolls through the top cutting about three-quarters of the way through. Smother the inside edges with a little butter and drizzle a little of the gravy in the base of the roll. Stuff the roll with the shredded beef and top with some more gravy.
- Serve immediately. The gravy and beef can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days. Use leftover gravy and beef stuffed in puff pastry for an easy dinner.

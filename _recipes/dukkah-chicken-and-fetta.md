tags: quick

ingredients:
- 1 Sweet Potato
- 1 Zucchini
- 1 Red Capsicum
- 1 Red Onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 bag of parsley
- 1/2 lemon
- 2 tsp plain flour
- 1.5 sachets of dukkah
- 1 small pack of chicken breast
- 25g fetta
- 50g chargrilled capsicum relish (for sauce)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 220/200 fan-forced. Cut the sweet potato (unpeeled) into 1cm chunks. Cut the zucchini and red capsicum into 2cm chunks. Cut the red onion into 1cm wedges. Finely chop the garlic (or use a garlic press). Finely chop the parsley leaves. Slice the lemon into wedges. 
- Place the sweet potato, zucchini, red capsicum, red onion and garlic on an over tray lined with baking paper. Drizzle with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then arrange in a single layer. Roast for 25-30 minutes, or until tender. 
- While the veggies are roasting, combine the plain flour and dukkah on a plate. Rub a drizzle of olive oil over the chicken breast, then turn to coat in the dukkah flour mix. In a large frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat. Add the dukkah chicken and cook for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Transfer to a second oven tray lined with baking paper. 
- In the last 15 minutes of the veggie cook time, bake the chicken for 6-10 minutes (depending on the thickness) or until cooked through. Transfer to a place and set aside to rest for 5 minutes. 
- In a medium bowl, combine the roasted veggies, parsley and 1/2 the fetta. 
- Thickly slice the dukkah chicken. Divide the chicken and the roast vegetable medley between places. Service with the chargrilled capsicum relish and crumble the remaining fetta over the roast veggies. Serve with the lemon wedges.

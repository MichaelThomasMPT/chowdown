books: [desserts]

ingredients:
- 3 eggs (yolks and whites separated)
- 1/2 cup (110g) caster sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 250g mascarpone (use a good brand, not a home brand variety)
- 1 & 1/4 cups black coffee
- 2 tbsp Kahlua or Frangelico
- 200g Lady Fingers
- Cocoa (for dusting)

directions:
- Beat yolks and sugar in stand mixer or electric beater on speed 6 to 7 for 10 minutes or until it changes from yellow to pale yellow (almost white), and is thick (see video for consistency).
- Add vanilla and mascarpone, beat until just combined and smooth. Transfer mixture to a bowl, set aside.
- Clean bowl and whisk. Add egg whites and beat until it's stiff (3 minutes on speed 7, should be all white foam, see video!)
- Add 1/2 the cream mixture into the egg whites. Gently fold through. When most incorporated, add the remaining cream mixture and fold through until just combined - don't bash out all the air in the egg whites! (Note 4)
- Mix coffee and liquor together. Quickly dip biscuits in and line the bottom of a 8‚Äù/20cm square dish. (See video or step photos above to see how I arrange them).
- Spread over half the cream, then top with another layer of coffee dipped biscuits.
- Spread with remaining cream.
- Cover, refrigerate for at least 4 - 5 hours, preferably overnight
- Dust with cocoa powder just before serving - either before you cut or after placing onto serving plates.

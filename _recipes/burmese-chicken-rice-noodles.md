ingredients:
- 300gm dried rice noodles (Pad Thai noodles work well)
- 1 x large onion
- 4 x medium garlic cloves
- 25gm fresh ginger
- 300gm tomatoes
- 1 x large sweetcorn cob
- peanut or vegetable oil
- 2Tbsp tomato paste
- ½ tsp dried turmeric
- ¼ tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 600gm chicken mince
- 2Tbsp fish sauce
- 1Tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 cup frozen baby peas
- ¼ cup chopped roasted peanuts (to serve)
- ¼ cup finely sliced spring onion (to serve)
- ¼ cup crispy fried shallots (to serve)

directions:
- Place rice noodles in large bowl. Boil kettle and pour over water to totally immerse noodles. Noodles will take between 7 to 10 minutes to cook with this soaking (off-the-heat) method. Move noodles around occasionally to ensure they are not stuck together.
- Once soft but still have a ‘bite’ to them, drain. Rinse noodle with cold water to halt cooking process. Set aside. NOTE - Noodles will be added to wok once chicken is cooked and will complete their cooking.
- Prepare chopped peanuts and sliced spring onions to serve. Set aside with crispy fried shallots.
- Make spiced chicken. Finely chop onion. Crush garlic. Peel and grate ginger. Cut tomatoes and pulp into 1cm dice. Remove kernels from corn with sharp knife. Set aside.
- Place wok over high heat.
- Once hot, fry chicken mince in 2 batches, each with 1 tablespoon oil for a couple of minutes, until colour changes. Remove from wok.
- Add 1½ tablespoons oil to wok.
- Fry onion over medium high heat for a few minutes, until softening.
- Turn heat down and add garlic and ginger. Stir briefly then immediately add tomato, tomato paste, turmeric and chilli flakes (if using).
- Cook for a further 5 minutes, simmering, until tomato has softened.
- Return chicken with any resting juices to wok and stir through tomato mix to heat through.
- Add fish and soy sauce. Stir through corn kernels and peas to heat through for a minute or so. Taste for seasoning and add more salt using fish and/or soy sauces if liked.
- Re-rinse rice noodles under warm running water to loosen and warm through. Drain well and toss through chicken in wok.
- Serve piles of noodles topped with peanuts, spring onions and shallots.

tags: long, pressure-cooker

ingredients:
- Nori (seaweed sheets, optional garnish)
- Menma (bamboo shoots, optional garnish)
- Naruto (pink & white eraser-looking thing, optional garnish)
- Scallions (optional garnish)
- Noodles, ideally the No. 20 Kaedama from Sun Noodles.

directions:
- Two days before, start preparing the tare.
- One or two days before, prepare the ajitsuke tamago.
- One or two days before, prepare the aroma oil. 
- One day before, start preparing the broth
- One day before, finish preparing the tare, putting the finished tare in the fridge.
- One day before, cook the chashu.
- On the day, finish preparing the broth.
- On the day, cut the chashu.
- Finally, assemble the ramen bowls. Bring a large pot of unsalted water to boil over high heat. Place broth in a separate pot and bring to a simmer over high heat; try not to let the broth boil, as boiling will make it more opaque. Set out containers of tare, aroma oil, and freshly ground white pepper, along with appropriate measuring spoons and serving bowls, and make sure all garnishes and toppings are close at hand.
- Ladle 5 ounces (150ml) boiling water into each serving bowl to warm it. After 30 seconds, place noodles in the pot of boiling water and stir vigorously with chopsticks or tongs to prevent sticking.
- Discard water in serving bowls. Place 2 tablespoons (30ml) tare, 2 teaspoons (10ml) aroma oil, 1/8 teaspoon white pepper, and a pinch of sliced scallions in the bottom of each serving bowl. Add about 1 1/2 cups (350ml) hot broth to each bowl.
- When noodles are cooked, drain them thoroughly using a fine-mesh strainer or noodle basket, shaking off as much excess water as possible, then place a serving of noodles in each bowl of hot broth. Stir noodles with chopsticks or tongs, then lift and fold noodles over.
- Garnish with sliced pork belly, more scallions, ajitsuke tamago (if using), and whatever other toppings you have at hand. Serve immediately.

This recipe is a combination of several other recipes (see individual components). The assemply instructions are by [Sho Spaeth](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/12/chintan-shoyu-ramen-recipe.html).

The broth, tare, and aroma oil will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Frozen, they will keep for up to 3 months, although the tare's flavor will degrade slightly (the broth and aroma oil will hold up better). The pork belly, if wrapped well in plastic wrap, will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator; tightly wrapped and placed in a freezer bag, it will keep for up to 3 months in the freezer with little to no decline in quality.

**Prep:** 1-2 days  
**Cook:** 6+ hours

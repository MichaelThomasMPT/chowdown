tags: long, slow-cooker

ingredients:
- 2kg pork shoulder, cut into 2 or 3 pieces
- 1 onion, roughly diced
- 1 stalk lemongrass, bruised
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2 tablespoons grated ginger
- ½ cup char siu sauce
- ½ cup rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 cup shredded cabbage
- 1 cup shredded red cabbage
- 1 carrot, shredded
- 6 snow peas, trimmed and finely shredded
- 2 spring onions, thinly sliced
- 1 red chilli, seeded and finely sliced (optional)
- 2 tablespoon Kewpie mayonnaise
- 24 small brioche buns or 6 regular brioche buns
- Gherkins to serve

directions:
- Place the chopped onion and lemon grass into a heavy base slow cooker or large pot and place pork on top.
- In a bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, char siu sauce, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and sugar.
- Pour the sauce over the pork and cover with a piece of baking paper and place the lid on top. Put the slow cooker or stove on low heat and cook for 6 hours. (If using leftover cooked roast, simply cook till heated through and soft)
- Once cooked, place the pork onto a large tray that will collect the juices and gently pull the meat apart with two forks.
- Once all the pork has been pulled, mix in with the pan juices to moisten. Cover and keep warm.
- For the slaw, use a large mixing bowl to toss together the salad ingredients together and toss through with Kewpie mayonnaise (to your liking).
- Assemble the slider by lightly toasting the buns and topping with the pulled pork and Asian slaw. Serve with gherkins on the side.

tags: long

ingredients:
- 20ml (1 tablespoon) oil
- 1/2 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 400g can crushed/diced tomatoes
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar, firmly packed
- Salt and pepper
- 400g skinless chicken breast fillets or tenderloins
- 2 eggs
- 20ml (1 tablespoon) milk
- 50g (1/3 cup) plain flour
- About 150g (about 1 1/3 cups) packaged breadcrumbs
- About 125ml (1/2 cup) oil, for frying
- 140g (1 1/3 cups, firmly packed) grated mozzarella cheese
- 40g (1/2 cup, lightly packed) grated tasty cheddar cheese
- 22g (1/4 cup) grated parmesan cheese

directions:
- Heat oil in a heavy-based medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until onion has softened but not browned. Add tomatoes, basil and brown sugar, increase heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer for about 35-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce has reached the desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside for 10 minutes, and then puree sauce in a blender or food processor.
- Trim any fat from chicken. If using chicken breasts, cut them in half horizontally. Cover chicken with a freezer bag and lightly pound with the flat side of meat mallet to flatten. 
- Whisk eggs and milk together in a bowl. Coat one piece of chicken in flour and shake to remove excess. Then dip the chicken into the egg and milk mixture ensuring that all of the flour is moistened.
- Then coat the chicken in breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to ensure crumbs adhere. Repeat with remaining pieces of chicken.
- To fry chicken, heat some of the oil in a heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat. We cook the chicken in two batches using 1/4 cup of oil for each batch (the number of batches will be determined by the size of your frying pan and you'll need to divide the oil evenly between each batch). Fry the chicken in a single layer, without overcrowding the pan, until golden brown and cooked through.
- Wipe the pan out with paper towels between each batch of chicken to remove any crumbs. This prevents the overcooked loose crumbs adhering to the next batch of chicken.
- Drain cooked chicken on paper towels. Place cooked chicken in a large baking dish and spread with sauce. Sprinkle with combined cheeses.
- Bake at 200 degrees Celsius (180 degrees fan-forced) for about 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden. We sprinkle the chicken parmigiana with chopped parsley before serving.

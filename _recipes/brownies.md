Recipe by Donna Hay in the book *[Basics to Brilliance](https://www.booktopia.com.au/basics-to-brilliance-donna-hay/book/9781460751428.htm)*.

`TIPS: If you're not serving the brownie warm, let it cool in the tin, then turn out and slice into squares. It'll continue to set in the tin, but stay soft and fudgy in the centre. The two types of sugar in these brownies work their magic in different ways. Caster sugar lends sweetness and helps create a smooth and crispy top. Brown sugar adds to the rich, moist centre. Brownies will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 week.`

tags: quick, vegetarian

ingredients:
- 2x 400g cans of whole peeled tomatoes (crushed/diced is fine)
- ~950ml chicken broth or stock (use vegetable stock to make this vegetarian)
- 2 heaping tablespoons minced garlic (optional)
- 1 cup heavy (thickened) cream
- 1 cup (or less) parmesan cheese
- Salt & pepper

directions:
- Puree the tomatoes in a blender or food processor.
- Pour the tomatoes, broth, and garlic in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes. (taste the mixture and if it is bitter or sour, add 1/4-1/2 tsp. baking soda to neutralize the flavor)
- Stir 1/4 cup hot soup into the heavy cream to temper it. Add the tempered cream and Parmesan cheese. Bring the soup back to a very slight boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes.
- Puree the soup again with an immersion blender to make it smooth and creamy.
- Serve with shredded parmesan cheese, grilled cheese sandwich croutons, and fresh basil, if desired.

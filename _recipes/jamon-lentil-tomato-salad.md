ingredients:
- 60g black lentils
- 150g mixed heirloom tomatoes
- 4x large green olives
- 6x black olies
- 50g white salad onion
- 50g baby spinach leaves
- 15g basil leaves
- 15g flat leaf parsley leaves
- 6x large slices Jamon
- 80ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1.5 Tbsp sherry vinegar
- 1x small clove garlic, crushed
- 1 Tbsp finely chopped basil leaves
- salt & pepper

directions:
- Cook lentils for 20 minutes in *simmering* water, until tender but holding their shape. Drain.
- Meanwhile, prepare rest of salad. Keep all components in separate piles in big bowl. Toss with dressing only when ready to serve so salad remains super fresh and perky.
- Cut tomatoes in half or quaters if large. Slice flesh from green olives and discard stones. Tear open kalamatas using hands, discard stones. Cut white onion from root to tip in extra-super-thin slices. Wash, dry and pick whole leaves from herb stalks, gently tearing basil leaves if large.
- Make dressing, place all ingredients into screw top jar and shake to form an emulsion. Set aside. 
- Tear each slice of jamon into 3 to 4 pieces and set aside on covered plate (in fridge if not serving immediately). 
- When ready to serve pour dressing over pile of lentils in bowl and mix all components together using your hands to prevent bruising of leaves.
- Place on small plates and serve immediately.

From [Matters of Taste](https://mattersoftaste.com.au/online-cooking-class/salad-of-jamon-lentils-and-heirloom-tomatoes/). Spanish ham, Jamon, is prepared from the leg of a Spanish breed of black pig. Fed on acorns, the pork develops a wonderful sweet, nutty flavour, less salty than its' Italian counterpart, prosciutto. Jamon Iberico is hte highest quality and price, but hte more reasonable Serrano still tastes amazing! Use large tomato wedges if small heirlooms are not available.

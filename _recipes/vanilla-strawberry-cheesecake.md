- Slice strawberries and toss gently with raspberries. Pile on top of cheesecake and dredge generously with icing sugar. Serve.

From [Matters of Taste](https://mattersoftaste.com.au/recipes/vanilla-strawberry-cheesecake/). Makes 24cm cheesecake. This can be made a couple of days before serving, just keep covered and refrigerated. Use full-fat Philadelphia cheese for best results. If concerned about calories, serve a smaller slice! The flavour and texture will make up for the portion size. Use quality vanilla for best flavour. The sky is the limit when flavouring this cheesecake so be inventive by adding other ingredients to the cheesecake mix or pouring sauce on top when serving. Be careful when incorporating extra liquid, take into account how the additions may affect the setting of the cheesecake.

ingredients:
- 1.2kg royal blue potatoes
- 100ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1.5 tsp Spanish mild paprika
- 50g fresh coriander
- 1 small clove garlic
- 1/4 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 Tbsp sherry vinegar
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1.5 tsp salt and pinch pepper

directions:
- Pre-heat oven to 210 degrees with large roasting tin in oven.
- Cut unpeeled potatoes into 2cm chunks. Simmer in salted water about 6 minutes, until half cooked. Drain and replace potatoes in saucepan. Season with salt and paprika and shake pan to fluff potatoes around the edges. 
- Pour oil into hot roasting tin and carefully tip in potatoes. Shake pan to spread into single layer. Roast potatoes for 40 to 50 minutes, until very crisp and golden.
- Make mojo sauce. Wash coriander plants, scrape roots clean of wispy bits and roughly chop with leaves and stalks.
- Crush/chop garlic and place with remaining ingredients in large jug.
- Blend well with stick blender to make sauce.
- Taste and adjust seasoning. Salt will balance out sourness of vinegar.
- On serving, re-season potatoes with a little extra salt. Drizzle half mojo sauce on platter. Pile on potatoes and drizzle remainder of sauce on top. Serve.

From [Matters of Taste](www.mattersoftaste.com.au). Mojo sauce is a traditional Spanish accompaniment to meat or fish dishes and marries particularly well with poultry or pork. Substitute coriander with parsley or mint if preferred for a different flavour. Adapt the spiciness according to your taste by using less or more chilli in sauce.

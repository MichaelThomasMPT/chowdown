tags: long, smoker

ingredients:
- Woodchips for smoking
- 4 brioche buns
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 3/4 tsp salt
- Ground white pepper
- 2 large chicken breasts
- Salad or coleslaw for burger
- Kewpi mayo or aioli for burger

directions:
- Soak two good handfuls of wood chips as per instructions on packet. Place into smoker box and place on BBQ grill. Close lid. Pre-heat barbeque on high for about 5 minutes. Once woodchips are smoking, turn head to medium low.
- Toss chicken breasts with olive oil, 3/4 tsp salt and a dozen grinds of white pepper. Place chicken on cooling rack on a foil-lined baking tray. 
- Place about 1 cup boiled water from kettle into heatproof bowl and place on BBQ next to tray of chicken. If possible turn off the burners under the chicken to allow to cook more gently. 
- Depending on the size of the chicken breasts and the temperature of the BBQ, cook for 20 to 25 minutes, no need to turn. Chicken is ready when it is lightly golden and springy to the touch. Alternatively, use a meat thermometer, and remove when it reaches 75 degrees.
- Once cooked, remove from BBQ and rest, covered on a plate for 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle. 
- Cut chicken breasts in half and construct burgers with the salad or coleslaw, and top with mayo or aioli.

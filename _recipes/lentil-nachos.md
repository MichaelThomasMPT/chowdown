tags: quick

ingredients:
- 6 mini flour tortillas
- 1 capsicum
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tin lentils
- 125g sweetcorn
- 1 carrot
- 1/4 cup vinegar
- 1 tomato
- Some coriander
- 30g baby spinach leaves
- 1/2 sachet mexican fiesta spice blend (or similar)
- Small amount of tomato paste
- 20g butter
- 1/2 cup water
- Some shredded cheese
- Some sour cream

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 180Â°C fan-forced. 
- Cut the mini flour tortillas into wedges.
- Finely chop the capsicum and garlic. Drain and rinse the lentils. Drain the sweetcorn. Grate the carrot. 
- In a small bowl, combine the vinegar and a good pinch of sugar and salt.
- Make the salsa; in a large frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat. Cook the sweetcorn until lightly charred, 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile, finely chop the tomato and coriander (reserve some for garnish). Roughly chop the baby spinach leaves. In a medium bowl combine the tomato, baby spinach leaves, charred corn, coriander, and a small amount of vinegar.
- Place the tortilla wedges in a single layer on a lined oven tray. Drizzle (or spray) with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Bake until golden, 6-8 minutes. 
- Return the frying pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Whe nthe oil is hot, cook the capsicum and carrot for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the lentils and cook until tender, 2 minutes. Add the garlic and spice blend and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. 
- Stir through the tomato paste, butter, water, and then season. Simmer until teh sauce has thickened, 1-2 minutes. Add another splash of water if the mixture seems dry.
- Sprinkle the shredded Cheddar cheese over the lentil mixture, then cover with a lid or foil and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the cheese has melted, 2-3 minutes.
- Divide the tortilla chips between places and serve with the cheese lentil mixture, sour cream, corn salsa, and reserved coriander.

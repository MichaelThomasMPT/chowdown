tags: dessert, vegetarian

ingredients:
- 1 packet plain sweet biscuits -eg Marie, Nice, Arrowroot
- 3 tablespoons cocoa powder - Preferably 100 percent cocoa, Dutch (Blooker), but any brand is fine
- 1 cup desiccated coconut
- 1 cup extra coconut for rolling
- 1 can sweetened condensed milk
- 2-3 tablespoons rum - Bundy works well but any brand OK

directions:
- In food processor, finely crush biscuits. Add cocoa powder, coconut, sweetened condensed milk and rum. Combine until mixed well. 
- Roll 1 tablespoon of mixture into a ball and roll in extra coconut. Repeat - makes 30-40. Need to work fairly fast when rolling because mixture dries out quickly. It's easier to roll and less messy if wearing disposable food handling gloves when rolling.
- Freeze on a baking tray. When frozen, move to storage container and keep in freezer ready for use.

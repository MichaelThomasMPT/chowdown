tags: long, pressure-cooker

ingredients:
- Approx 600g boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup Thai peanut sauce
- 3/4 cup chicken broth
- Approx 140g stir-fry rice noodles
- 1 cup sugar snap or snow peas
- optional garnishes - chopped peanuts red pepper flakes, green onions & cilantro

directions:
- Turn your pressure cooker to saute (cook with no lid) and lightly saute the peas for 1-2 until just slightly cooked. Remove peas and set aside. Turn off of saute.
- Add the chicken, Thai peanut sauce and broth to the pot. Cook on high pressure for 12 minutes.
- Release the steam by turning the nozzle and remove the chicken from pot, leaving the sauce. To the sauce, add the noodles and ensure all of the dry noodles are submerged in sauce. Top with the peas and replace the cover as quickly as possible. Change the settings to slow cooker (ie. put it on the lowest heat with the lid closed), and cook for 10 minutes or until the noodles are soft but firm.
- Meanwhile, shred the chicken breasts and set aside.
- Remove the lid of the pressure cooker and give the noodles a good stir. Add the chicken back to the pot with the noodles. Cook on slow cooker mode for an additional 10 minutes. Serve warm.

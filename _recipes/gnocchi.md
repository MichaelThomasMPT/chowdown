ingredients:
- 1.5 cups (360g) fresh ricotta (ideally full-cream)
- 1 cup (80g) finely grated parmesan
- 1 cup (150g) plain (all-purpose) flour
- 3 eggs
- 1.5 teaspoons sea salt flakes
- cracked black pepper
- 1/4 cup each finely chopped basil and flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon rind
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- 600g mixed cherry tomatoes
- finely grated parmesan and baby (micro) basil, to server

directions:
- Make gnocchi dough by placing the ricotta, parmesan, flour, eggs, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix until combined and a sticky dough forms. This dough should be a little sticky to work with.
- Add the chopped herbs and lemon rind to the gnocchi dough and mix to combine.
- Lightly dust a clean surface with flour. Divide the dough in half and roll each piece into a 3cm-wide log. Slice into 2cm-thick pieces and set aside on a lightly floured tray.
- Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over high heat. Add the garlic and tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes or until soft.
- Cook the gnocchi, in 2 batches, in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes or until firm and risen to teh surface. Remove with a slotted spoon and toss in the pan with the tomatoes. 
- Serve with the parmesan and baby basil.

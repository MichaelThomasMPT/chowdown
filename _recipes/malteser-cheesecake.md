tags: dessert, vegetarian

ingredients:
- 200g plain biscuits (I used granita)
- 80g unsalted butter
- 500g cream cheese
- 90g raw sugar (use caster sugar if not using a Thermomix)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 90g thickened cream
- 200g Maltesers

directions:
- Lightly grease a 23cm springform cake tin and set aside. I like to line the base with baking paper to ensure easy removal.
- Put half the Maltesers in a ziploc bag and lightly crush with a rolling pin. Set aside.
- Melt butter in a pan or in the microwave.
- Crush the biscuits using a food processor and add to the butter mixture. Press the biscuit mixture into the cake tin and pop into the fridge to chill while you make the filling 
- Mix the sugar, cream cheese, cream and vanilla until smooth and gently fold through the crushed Maltesers.
- Pour the mixture over the base and then chill for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight,  before serving.
- Just before serving, lightly crush the remaining Maltesers in a ziploc bag, leaving a few almost whole. Decorate with crushed Maltesers. Use a warm knife to cut slices for best results.

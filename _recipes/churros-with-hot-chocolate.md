ingredients:
- 250ml water
- 85g unsalted butter
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 150gm plain flour
- 2 x 59g extra large eggs
- 1 tsp finely grated orange zest
- vegetable oil for frying
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 2/3 cup caster sugar
- 600ml milk
- 3 tsp dutch cocoa
- 110g 70% bittersweet chocolate
- 1 to 2 Tbsp caster sugar
- 3 tsp cornflour mixed with 2 Tbsp cold water
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

directions:
- To make churros, place water, butter and salt in covered saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to boil to allow butter to melt.
- When simmering, remove lid and immediately add flour. Stir with wooden spoon to form lumpy dough, then beat vigorously for a minute or so, until mixture comes away from side of pan.
- Transfer dough to a large mixing bowl. Cool for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
- Add eggs one at a time, beating really well between additions (can be done in electric mixer with beater attachment) to form firm dough. Add orange zest and stir through. 
- Half fill piping bag with a number 7 star nozzle.
- Meanwhile, heat deep fryer or 4cm vegetable oil in deep stainless steel saucepan to 180 degrees celcius.
- To make hot chocolate, heat milk with cocoa, caster sugar and chocolate in saucepan. Mix cornflour with water and add to pan. Stir often, and once simmering and slightly thickened, turn off head and stir through vanilla extract. Turn off heat and cover pan to keep chocolate warm.
- Mix cinnamon with sugar in large bowl and set aside for coating cooked churros.
- Cook mixture in batches. Pipe 6 x 8cm lengths churros into oil, cut off dough with small knife dipped in hot oil to avoid dough sticking. This amount will make about 24 x 8cm churros.
- Cook churros for about 4 minutes, until golden, they should be crisp on outside and soft and fluffy on inside (not sticky and doughy).
- When ready, remove churros from oil. Drain briefly on absorbent paper and immediately toss in spiced caster sugar to coat.
- Pour hot chocolate into small serving cups and serve on plate with warm sugar crusted churros to dip.

From [Matters of Taste](www.mattersoftaste.com.au). Churros can be cooked ahead of time and heater in a 180 degree oven for 3-4 minutes before serving. Make churros shorter (to prevent 'double-dipping') and serve with a large bowl of hot chocolate to share with friends. Ensure cinnamon used is fresh and fragrant. Cassia can be used in place of cinnamon and has a similar flavour, slightly sweeter and cheaper to buy. For hot chocolate we recommend a 58% bittersweet chocolate or if a more savoury style is preferred use 70% chocolate. Dutch cocoa is recommended as it has had the bitterness removed, is delicious and melts into milk easily. Add vanilla to hot chocolate off the heat as it will evaporate if chocolate is simmering. Omit orange from churros if preferred, we just like the citrus flavour with the chocolate. A pinch of ground cardamom added to the hot chocolate or churros dough will give an exocit flavour.

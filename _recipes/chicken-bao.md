ingredients:
- (1 lb 2 oz) boned chicken thighs, cut into 5 cm (2 inch) strips
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 300 g (10½ oz/2 cups) plain (all-purpose) flour mixed with 1 tsp salt
- oil, for deep-frying
- 1 large handful basil
- 1 large handful coriander (cilantro)
- 1 tbsplight soy sauce
- ½ tspChinese five-spice
- ½ tspchilli powder
- ½ tspsalt, to taste
- ½ tspwhite pepper
- 1 tspcornflour (cornstarch) 
- ½quantity bao dough (see recipe below)
- vegetable oil, for brushing

directions:
- Make the dough and pickled carrot the night before.
- Combine the soy sauce, chinese five-spice, chilli powder, salt, white pepper and cornflour in a bowl, add the chicken and stir to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
- Make the Sriracha Mayonnaise and set aside.
- To make the gua bao, roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 10 pieces. Roll each into a ball, then flatten with the palm of your hand. Sprinkle with flour and roll each into a 15 cm (6 inch) oval. Brush with oil, fold in half and press gently. Place on squares of baking paper and leave to prove until doubled in size (about 1 hour). Steam the buns in batches in a steamer until puffed (8–10 minutes).
- Meanwhile, combine the beaten eggs and 125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) water in a bowl. Place the seasoned flour in a shallow bowl. Dip the chicken pieces in the eggwash, then the flour, shaking off the excess.
- Heat oil in a deep-fryer or wok to 180°C or until a piece of bread browns in 10 seconds, and deep-fry the chicken in batches until golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. When all the chicken is done, deep-fry the basil for a couple of seconds until crisp. Drain on paper towel.
- To serve, stuff the chicken pieces into the split bao with carrots, fried basil and coriander, and top with mayonnaise.

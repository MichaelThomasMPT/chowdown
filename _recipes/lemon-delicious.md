ingredients:
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup castor sugar
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tablespoon self-raising flour
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- pouring cream (optional, to serve)

directions:
- Separate eggs; place whites and yolks into 2 separate small bowls. Add sugar to egg yolks in small bowl, beat with electric mixer until thick and creamy. Gradually beat in milk on low speed, then sifted flour and lemon juice. Pour into large bowl.
- Beat egg whites in small bowl with electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold into egg yolk mixture in 2 batches. Use a plastic spatula for this; do not stir or beat or you will deflate the mixture. Mixture will look a bit curdled, but this is correct. 
- Pour mixture into deep ovenproof dish (4 cup capacity). Stand dish in baking dish, add enough boiling water to baking dish to come halfway-up side of ovenproof dish. Bake in moderate oven for about 45 minutes or until form to touch. Sprinkle with a little sifted icing sugar, if desired.
- Serve with pouring cream.

ingredients:
- 0.9-1.2kg slab of pork belly, skin removed
- Salt and pepper
- 1/2 cup Japanese soy sauce
- 1/4 cup mirin
- 1 cup water
- 1 Tbsp. brown sugar
- 1/4 cup sake
- 8 cloves garlic (or other aromatics you like, such as ginger, green onion, white onions)


directions:
- Depending on the thickness of your pork, you may want to roll it. Generally I roll the belly if it’s less than 2-inches thick, aiming for a full roll around three inches in diameter. Simply curl the belly around itself, and wrap butchers twine to hold it in shape. Don’t worry too much about how beautifully you tie it up, just make sure it’s wrapped nice and tightly.
- In a saucepan, Dutch oven, or other lidded pot just barely big enough to hold your pork belly, sear the pork belly on all sides, over medium-high heat, around three minutes a side, turning to ensure even browning.
- While the pork cooks, combine the soy sauce, mirin, water, and brown sugar in a bowl.
- Once browned, remove the pork, set aside. Wipe the pan with a paper towel to clean out any residual fat that may have rendered out. You could also reserve this fat if you prefer, it’s lard, and delicious. But you’ll probably need to wipe down the pan for the next step.
- Deglaze the pan with the sake. If you didn’t wipe down the pan, expect a grease fire, as the fat billows into the air as a cloud of small droplets of fat that is prone to exploding into a fire ball. So wipe down the pan before this step.
- Add the soy mixture, garlic, and pork, and bring to a simmer. Don’t worry if the pork isn’t fully covered, the steam will help cook the belly.
- Once bubbling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and allow the pork to simmer until tender, around 2 1/2 hours, turning it occasionally to ensure the belly is covered by the braising liquid. I check the belly at around the 2:15 mark for doneness, prodding the pork to feel its texture. The fat on the outside should be very tender and yielding.
- Remove the pot from heat, allow the pork to cool in the liquid for one hour, before transferring to a container with the braising liquid and chilling in the fridge overnight.

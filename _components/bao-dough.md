title:  "Bao Dough"
image: bao-dough.jpg

ingredients:
- 60 g (2¼ oz) caster (superfine) sugar
- 250 ml (9 fl oz/1 cup) lukewarm water
- 1½ tsp dried yeast
- 430 g (15¼ oz) cake flour
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- ½ tsp rice vinegar

directions:
- To make the dough, dissolve the sugar in the lukewarm water, stir in the yeast and set aside in a draught-free place for 10 minutes until it turns foamy.
- Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the yeast mixture, oil, vinegar and a pinch of salt, then, using a wooden spoon, stir until well combined. Turn out onto a lightly floured bench and knead for 8–10 minutes until the dough is soft and pliable (this can also be done in an electric mixer with a dough hook attachment).
- Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat evenly, cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel, and set aside in a draught-free place until doubled in size (1–2 hours or up to 3–4 hours on a cold day).
- Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough in half.

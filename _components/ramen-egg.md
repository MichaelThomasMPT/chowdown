ingredients:
- 2 large eggs (You can make up to 6; refrigerated till Step 3)
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp mirin
- 3-6 Tbsp water (Feel free to adjust saltiness)

directions:
- Gather all the ingredients.  With this recipe, you can use up to 4-6 eggs.
- In a resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, mirin, and water (start with 3 Tbsp water and taste before adding more water). Set aside.
- Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. There should be enough water to cover the eggs (should be 1 inch above eggs).
- When boiling, take out the eggs from the refrigerator and carefully submerge the eggs into water with a mesh strainer/skimmer or ladle.
- Immediately reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook the eggs for exactly 7 minutes. Make sure the water is simmering, but not so hot that the eggs bounce around. For custard-like egg yolk but not runny, instead cook this for 8 to 9 minutes.
- After 7 minutes, immediately take out the eggs and soak in the ice bath to stop them from cooking further. Let them cool for 3 minutes.
- The soft boiled eggs are not completely hardened so gently peel the eggs.
- Put the eggs in the sauce bag and close tightly. The eggs should be submerged in the marinade. Let them marinate overnight to up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator. 
- Take out the eggs and cut in halves to serve. Enjoy the eggs by themselves or use them as a ramen topping.

ingredients:
- approx 900g neck bones
- approx 900g femurs, split to expose marrow
- approx 180g fatback
- 6 garlic cloves for aromatics (optional)


directions:
- The night before, or at least 6 hours prior to cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting tonkotsu is whiter in appearance).
- When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you’ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising up. This blanch is integral for a white tonkotsu, don’t skip it, and don’t end it prematurely.
- Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid.
- Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices. 
- Add your now clean bones to a pressure cooker, covering with just enough water. Bring to a boil, then cover, bring to full pressure (15 PSI), and cook under pressure for 2 hours
- Fast release the pot, being careful to avoid splashes (if your pressure cooker doesn’t have this feature, regular release is fine).  Give the contents a stir, then cover, bring to high pressure again, and cook for 1 hour.
- Remove pressure and open the cooker. Add in your fatback, give it a stir, bring the contents back to a boil, and cook under pressure for one more hour.
- Depressurize the pot. Remove the fatback, adding it to a blender. Blend with an appropriate amount of broth until the fatback is completely broken down into a liquid, then add this back to the broth.  No chunks here, we’re looking for smooth liquid.
- If using, add aromatics to the now uncovered broth
- Cook, uncovered, at a rapid boil, for 45 minutes, or until the broth is opaque, creamy, and to the desired consistency you want. Stir occasionally to prevent scorching on the bottom of the pot.
- Strain and reserve as needed. Conversely, store in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze for several months.

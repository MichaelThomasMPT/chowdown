ingredients:
- 1kg boneless pork belly
- 1 tablespoon sea salt flakes
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 onion, sliced into 1cm rounds
- 1 lemon, sliced into 1cm rounds

directions:
- Using a small sharp knife, score the pork skin at 1cm intervals.
- Pat the skin dry with paper towel. For the crunchiest pork crackling, be sure to thoroughly dry the skin.
- Rub the salt and oil into the skin and incisions.
- If you have the time, you can refrigerate the pork, uncovered, for 2 hours or overnight. This will let the skin dry out even further, before you oil and salt the rind. 
- Remove pork from fridge an hour before cooking.
- Preheat oven to 180°C 
- Place the pork, skin-side down, on an oven tray and roast for 1 hour 30 minutes.
- Remove the pork from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 220°C.
- Working quickly, arrange the onion and lemon on the oven tray next to the pork. Turn the pork over onto the onion and lemon. Roast for a further 20-30 minutes or until the skin is golden and crispy and the meat is tender.
- Leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
